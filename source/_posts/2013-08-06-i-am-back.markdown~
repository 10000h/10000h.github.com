Almost one year since I blogged last time. Lots of things happened
during this year. I somehow get to know more about myself but still struggle with
some of my bad habits like addiction to internet, etc. 

Recently I started a new blog on wordpress. 
The reason is that it is quite convenient. I can almost blog from any computers. But I 
still miss here because it is something new to me. Definitely I will not close this blog. 

I will try to clone this blog to my mac air (Now it's in my thinkpad). So it might be
the last time I blog in my thinkpad. Hope it works well so that I can continue to blog
here.

Right now I am still trying to find out what I am really into and good at.
